                <p>DT gives feedback to everybody who completes the selection process. At times people take 1-2 months to work on themselves and then re-apply to us.</p>

                <p>You're the sum of the 5 people around you. Let's dive deep. Richard Feynman says "It's difficult to keep reminding yourself of the important questions". So good mentoring/guidance is just those reminders. The DT learning drills are less gyan, more of introspection reminders. Would you like to experience this first hand? Complete the next 2-3 rounds and you'd get to observe the DT ecosystem in the last round. </p>
